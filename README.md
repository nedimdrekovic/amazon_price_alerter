## Features (new features coming soon)
1. ```Url and Price```: type url + desired_price

2. ```Adding Product```: press the button ```Add```

     2.1. Check if inputs are valid.
     ```
       valid url: existing amazon url that hasn't been added to the list yet
       valid price: price needs to be a number (german standard)
     ```      
     Examples:
     ```
     1.3 --> valid
     1,3 --> changed to 1.3 --> valid
     100.557 --> rounded down to 100.55
     9999.56,34 --> invalid
     9999,56.34 --> invalid
     ```
   
3. ```Deleting Product```: deletes product from list by pressing the button ```Delete``` on the product's field.



## ToDo's:
- better UI for listing products
- feature for notifying user when product is available
- add loading symbol during scraping process
